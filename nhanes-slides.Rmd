# Goal
1. To explore the exposures measured in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) dataset in search of factors associated with cancer mortality and
2. to assess a variable selection method for cancer risk prediction models.

# Data
The core data and corresponding documentation are for the survey interview and examination components are found in four separate data files:

# Analyze variables in the context of a significance threshold (p < 10^-10^)
