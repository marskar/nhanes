sexsteroid hormane concentrations and risk of death in US men
menke et al

[b]
limitation: cancer-specific death only in restricted
mostly lung 
risk factors not therapeutic success: exclude baseline cancer cases
stratify by smoking status: conditioning on smoking 
adjust 
Research question: new causes lethal cancer 
not dealing with therapy
risk factors not therapeutic success

men and women are different
stratify by sex
discover beyond known factors

 have at least

 say what hypothesis and question are 
 factors beyond smoking gender BMI 
 can I identify preiously unknown factors?
 risk factors for cancer that has a lethal phenotype
 starting with people that do not have a cancer diagnosis

 Decision
 Only include people who have had a medical exam
MCQ220 == "NO"
 restrict to age>=50 

 will the n be sufficient

 Just use NHANES III
continuous variable?
GWAS like analysis even if it 
p value based cutoff to have variables rise to the top 
p-value and strength of association 
identify variables for further analysis
I need to define a cutoff.



ARIC

Look at comments in proposal
Then take it Nilanjan and then VASAN.


Keep it simple
lotsa of lung cancer, lots unexplained, despite not smoking
more specific 
find new risk factors
