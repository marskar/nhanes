**Context:** Large epidemiologic studies, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), collect copious high-dimensional data that allow for examination of multiple exposures in relation to a given outcome.

**Objective:** To explore the exposures measured in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) dataset in search of factors associated with cancer mortality and to assess a variable selection method for cancer risk prediction models.

**Methods:** We fit thousands of Cox proportional hazards models with and without ridge penalties to randomly selected subsets of up to 50 variables. We analyzed the descriptions of NHANES III variables provided by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and selected 3 variables known to be related to cancer risk (age, sex and race/ethnicity) to include in all future models. We then compared highly significant variables (p < 10^-10^) that appeared most frequently in the Cox models and selected 5 high-frequency highly significant variables that we used to train a new group of models with fewer randomized variables.

**Results:** The models with fewer randomized variables outperformed the fully randomized models in terms of concordance. Across all of the models, the ten variables that most frequently surpassed the p-value threshold were age, race/ethnicity, lifetime consumption of more than 100 cigarettes, 3 variables that pertain to physical activity and 3 variables that may be related to aging.

**Conclusions:** The work described here constitutes an exploratory analysis of the NHANES III dataset that employs an iterative strategy for the generation of cancer risk prediction models. Looking beyond this demonstration of a variable selection method, our ultimate goal is to build upon previously-described cancer risk factors towards the discovery of novel contributors to cancer risk, a deeper understanding of cancer etiology, and an improved ability to predict cancer incidence and mortality.
