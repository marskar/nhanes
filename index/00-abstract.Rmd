**Context:** Large epidemiologic cohort studies, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), collect copious high-dimensional data that allow for examination of multiple exposures in relation to a given outcome.

**Objective:** To explore the exposures measured in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) dataset in search of factors associated with cancer mortality data obtained from the National Death Index (NDI) and to assess methods for lethal cancer risk prediction model variable selection.

**Methods:** We fit thousands of Cox proportional hazards models with and without ridge penalties to randomly selected subsets of up to 50 variables. We analyzed the descriptions of NHANES variables provided by NCHS and selected 3 variables that are important, non-modifiable risk factors for cancer (age, sex and race/ethnicity) to include in all future models. We then compared variables that appeared most frequently in the Cox models with high significance (p < 10^-10^) and selected 5 high-frequency, highly significant variables that we used to train a new group of models with fewer randomized variables.

**Results:** The models with selected variables outperformed the fully randomized models in terms of concordance. Across all of the models, the ten variables that most frequently surpassed the p-value threshold were age, race/ethnicity, lifetime consumption of more than 100 cigarettes, 3 variables that pertain to physical activity and 3 variables that may be related to aging.

**Conclusions:** The work described here constitutes an exploratory analysis of the NHANES III dataset that employs an iterative strategy for the generation of cancer risk prediction models. Looking beyond this demonstration of a variable selection method, our ultimate goal is to build upon previously-described cancer risk factors towards the discovery of novel contributors to cancer risk, a deeper understanding of cancer etiology, and an improved ability to predict cancer incidence and mortality.
